This repository provides a basic building blocks to a database API. 
The database used in this project is a 'dummy' list of cafes in London containing certain information about their location, coffee price and others e.g. whether it has a wifi or not.
To learn more about how to access the API, see the API Documentation here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/42436886/2sAYdZuZkR
