This repository is a Python Capstone in relation to building an API for a database. 
The database used is a dummy list of cafes containing certain information (e.g. whether it has a wifi or not) in London.
To learn more about how to use the API, see Postman API Documentation here: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/42436886/2sAYdZuZkR
